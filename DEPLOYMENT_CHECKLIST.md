# 🚀 Deployment Checklist - 10 Minute Setup

Your platform is **live** but needs **3 quick fixes** to work perfectly.

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Fix Database Permissions (5 MIN) - CRITICAL!

This fixes: "Upload failed: new row violates row-level security policy"

**What to do:**
1. Open: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select project: `sxkmoiwpyxjyqrcctmhh`
3. Go to: **SQL Editor** → Click **"New Query"**
4. **Copy the SQL from** `SUPABASE_FIX_RLS.md` 
5. **Paste it** into the SQL editor (copy each block, one at a time)
6. **Click RUN** after each block
7. Wait for "Success" ✓

**Result**: Regular users can now upload tracks! ✅

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Become Admin (2 MIN) - OPTIONAL

This allows you to customize the platform appearance.

**What to do:**
1. In Supabase → Go to **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Find **your email** in the list
3. **Copy your User ID** (long string of letters/numbers)
4. Go back to **SQL Editor** → **New Query**
5. **Paste this SQL** (replace YOUR_USER_ID with the ID you copied):

```sql
UPDATE public.users SET is_admin = true WHERE id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

6. **Click RUN**

**Result**: You'll see the **⚙️ Admin** button in the header! ✅

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Redeploy Frontend (0 MIN)

The code is already fixed locally. If you're using git:

```powershell
cd c:\test
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix modals and UI functions"
git push
```

Or if using Netlify drag & drop:
- Just drag the **`dist` folder** onto Netlify dashboard

**Result**: Platform is live with all fixes! ✅
