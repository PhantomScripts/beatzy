## 🐛 Firefox Audio Fix

**Problem**: Audio wouldn't replay after first play in Firefox

**Solution**: Implemented in `dist/js/app.js` (lines 535-549)
- Proper DOM element creation (not innerHTML)
- Event listeners on audio creation
- currentTime reset logic
- Firefox user agent detection
- Metadata preloading

**Result**: ✅ Firefox audio replays work perfectly!
